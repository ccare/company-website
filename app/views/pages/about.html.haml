        .span6
            %p Meducation is a social network with a strong educational focus. We connect medics in a similar way to LinkedIn, plus we allow them to talk and discuss their progress through their careers. As they research new ideas, have questions they need answering, or knowledge they want to share, they can use Meducation to talk to their peers. 
            %p Over 30,000 medics have joined Meducation, including 33% of UK medical students.
