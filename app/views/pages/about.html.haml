        .span6
            %p Meducation is a social network with a strong educational focus. We connect medics in a similar way to LinkedIn, plus we allow them to talk and discuss their progress through their careers. As they research new ideas, have questions they need answering, or knowledge they want to share, they can use Meducation to talk to their peers.

He chatted to his friend Jeremy and together they made the first version of Meducation.
