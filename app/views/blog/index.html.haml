        %p For five years, Al and I have held the vision of Meducation closely in our hearts, watching it develop from a fun side-project into something that has the power to change the world. Meducation is a bit like a child for us and we've invested our lives into it as carefully tried to nurture it through its early stages. We're now at a time that's both exciting and scary in our journey, where for the first time we will give away some of that control to other people who join our team. 
        %p Today we're proud and excited to announce the first person we are entrusting that vision to: Rob Styles - our Employee #1.
